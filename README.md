## **Features**

* **Task System:** Players receive randomised objectives (e.g. restock shelves, deliver supplies).
* **Customer AI:** Simple NPC behaviour that interrupts the player with requests.
* **Shift Timer:** Each level has a countdown that determines success or failure.
* **Physics Interaction:** Players can pick up, move, and place objects within the store.
* **Level Progression:** Completing all objectives before time runs out advances the player; failing results in termination.

## **Purpose**

This project was created as part of a university computer graphics course to explore environment design, object interaction, and basic AI systems in Unreal Engine.
It also served as a first large-scale collaborative project using a professional game engine.
